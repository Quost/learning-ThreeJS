             * 
             * aspect: is the display aspect of the canvas. We'll go over the details in another article but by default a 
             * canvas is 300x150 pixels which makes the aspect 300/150 or 2.

             * range or after that range will be clipped (not drawn).

             * sliced off. In other words think of the word "frustum" as another 3D shape like sphere, cube, prism, frustum.
